# EDA on Zomato Dataset

In this guide, we'll walk through the process of conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset. We'll cover each step in detail, including data import, data cleaning, analysis of numerical and categorical variables, visualization of relationships between variables, and more.

## Step 1: Understanding the Dataset

Before diving into the analysis, it's essential to understand the dataset. The Zomato dataset contains information about restaurants, including their names, locations, cuisines, ratings, and more.

## Step 2: Importing Libraries

Start by importing the necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization. We'll commonly use Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## Step 3: Importing the Dataset

Next, import the Zomato dataset into your Python environment. You can download the dataset from the provided link or use a direct link to the CSV file.

```python
# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("zomato.csv")
```

## Step 4: Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is crucial to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis. Perform the following tasks:

### 4.1 Handling Missing Values

Check for missing values and decide how to handle them. You can either drop rows with missing values or impute them based on the context.

```python
# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print(missing_values)
```

### 4.2 Data Transformation

Convert data types if necessary. For example, convert string dates to datetime objects, or categorical variables to the appropriate data type.

```python
# Convert data types
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df['votes'] = df['votes'].astype(int)
```

## Step 5: Data Analysis

Now, let's perform various analyses on the dataset:

### 5.1 Descriptive Statistics

Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical variables to understand their distribution and central tendencies.

```python
# Descriptive statistics
statistics = df.describe()
print(statistics)
```

### 5.2 Exploring Categorical Variables

Analyze categorical variables using frequency tables or count plots to understand their distribution.

```python
# Explore categorical variables
cuisine_counts = df['cuisine'].value_counts()
print(cuisine_counts)

sns.countplot(x='location', data=df)
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.show()
```

### 5.3 Finding Relationships

Explore relationships between variables using correlation matrices, scatter plots, or pair plots.

```python
# Correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.show()

# Scatter plot
sns.scatterplot(x='cost', y='rating', data=df)
plt.xlabel('Cost')
plt.ylabel('Rating')
plt.title('Cost vs Rating')
plt.show()
```

## Step 6: Visualization

Visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the data. Create various plots to visualize the distribution of variables and relationships between them.

```python
# Histogram
sns.histplot(df['cost'], bins=20, kde=True)
plt.xlabel('Cost')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Cost')
plt.show()

# Box plot
sns.boxplot(x='online_order', y='rating', data=df)
plt.xlabel('Online Order')
plt.ylabel('Rating')
plt.title('Rating by Online Order Availability')
plt.show()
```

## Step 7: Interpretation and Conclusion

After conducting the analysis and visualization, interpret the findings and draw conclusions. Summarize the key insights obtained from the data.

```python
# Interpretation and Conclusion
print("Key Insights:")
print("- Restaurants in location X have the highest average rating.")
print("- There is a positive correlation between cost and rating.")
print("- Online orders seem to have a slight impact on ratings.")
```

## Step 8: Documentation and Reporting

Finally, document your analysis in a clear and concise manner. Create a report or presentation summarizing the analysis process, findings, and recommendations.

## Conclusion

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial first step in any data analysis project. By following these steps and techniques, you can gain valuable insights into the dataset and make informed decisions based on the data.
